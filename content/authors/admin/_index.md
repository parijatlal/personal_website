I'm a doctoral candidate in economics at Columbia University with an interest in studying issues related to development and inequality. So far, my research has focused on leveraging large-scale administrative data to answer questions in industrial development, labor, and public economics. **I am on the 2023-24 job market.**

Before graduate school, I worked on projects for the World Bank, WHO, and USAID as an analyst at Dalberg. I received a BA in economics from Harvard College, conducting research at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, J-PAL, and Udayan Care along the way.

I was born in Germany, and had the privilege of living in India (my home country), Iran, Austria, Thailand, and Kenya before coming to the US for college. I'm a big fan of (old school) hip hop, (Arsenal and Germany) football, reading historical fiction, and exploring different cuisines. Feel free to reach out!
