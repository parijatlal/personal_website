I'm a doctoral candidate in economics at Columbia University with an interest in studying public economics, development, and inequality. 

Before graduate school, I worked on projects for the World Bank, WHO, and USAID as an analyst at Dalberg. I received a BA in economics from Harvard College, conducting research at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), the Observer Research Foundation, and Udayan Care along the way.

I was born in Germany, and had the privilege of living in India (my home country), Iran, Austria, Thailand, and Kenya before coming to the United States for college. I'm a big fan of (old school) hip hop, (Arsenal and Germany) football, and exploring different cuisines. Please feel free to reach out if I can be of help!
